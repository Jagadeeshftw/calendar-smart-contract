## General Information
- This project was created to fulfill the need many developers face when building decentralized applications with on-chain meeting management functionality.  
- It provides a Solidity smart contract template to create, manage, and track meetings, ensuring transparency and immutability on the blockchain.
- It simplifies the implementation of features like meeting creation, rescheduling, participant management, and availability checks, serving as a foundation for your blockchain-based scheduling applications.

## Features
- Create a Meeting: Allows an organizer to create a meeting with participants, date, time, agenda, and link ‚úî
- Reschedule a Meeting: Organizer can reschedule the meeting by changing the date and time ‚úî
- Add Participants: Organizer can add participants to an existing meeting ‚úî
- Cancel a Meeting: Organizer can cancel the meeting ‚úî
- Check Meetings by Address: Retrieve all meetings for which a user is an organizer or participant ‚úî
- Check Availability: Checks if an address is available for a given date and time ‚úî

## Function's
### `createMeeting`
- **Purpose**: Allows an organizer to create a new meeting.
- **Parameters**:
  - `participants`: List of participants' addresses.
  - `date`: UNIX timestamp for the meeting date.
  - `startTime`: Start time of the meeting in seconds from midnight.
  - `endTime`: End time of the meeting in seconds from midnight.
  - `agenda`: A brief agenda of the meeting.
  - `meetLink`: Link to the meeting (e.g., Zoom/Google Meet link).
- **Details**:
  - Creates a new meeting and tracks it under the organizer and participants' addresses.
  - Emits the `MeetingCreated` event.

### `rescheduleMeeting`
- **Purpose**: Enables the organizer to reschedule an existing meeting.
- **Parameters**:
  - `meetingId`: ID of the meeting to be rescheduled.
  - `newDate`: New date for the meeting.
  - `newStartTime`: New start time of the meeting.
  - `newEndTime`: New end time of the meeting.
- **Details**:
  - Updates the date and time of the specified meeting.
  - Emits the `MeetingRescheduled` event.

### `addParticipants`
- **Purpose**: Allows the organizer to add new participants to an existing meeting.
- **Parameters**:
  - `meetingId`: ID of the meeting.
  - `newParticipants`: List of new participants' addresses.
- **Details**:
  - Adds only non-duplicate participants to the meeting.
  - Tracks the meeting under the new participants' addresses.
  - Emits the `ParticipantAdded` event for each added participant.

### `cancelMeeting`
- **Purpose**: Lets the organizer cancel an existing meeting.
- **Parameters**:
  - `meetingId`: ID of the meeting to be canceled.
- **Details**:
  - Marks the meeting as canceled.
  - Emits the `MeetingCancelled` event.

### `getMeetingsByAddress`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves all meetings (organized or participated) for a given address.
- **Parameters**:
  - `addr`: Address to retrieve meetings for.
- **Returns**: Array of meeting details for the specified address.

### `checkAvailability`
- **Purpose**: Checks if an address is available for a specific date and time.
- **Parameters**:
  - `addr`: Address to check availability for.
  - `date`: Meeting date.
  - `startTime`: Start time of the proposed meeting.
  - `endTime`: End time of the proposed meeting.
- **Returns**: `true` if the address is available, `false` otherwise.

### `addMeetingToUser`
- **Purpose**: Associates a meeting with a user's address.
- **Parameters**:
  - `user`: Address of the user.
  - `meetingId`: ID of the meeting.
- **Details**:
  - Ensures no duplicate meetings are added to the user's list.

### Main application
- Contract deployed here: [Calendar](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x16CEb1b26eC18522D461B88596aECca201144e0C)
- This project was implemented 100% with Solidity for smart contract development.
- Smart contract deployment and testing were carried out using the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) framework, which provides a robust environment for building and deploying Ethereum-based applications.
- The project leverages JavaScript for script automation and interaction with the deployed contracts.
- [Base Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.basescan.org/) was used for contract verification and exploring the deployed contract.

## Setup
1. Clone this project by doing:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sarvesh371/calendar-smart-contract.git
```
2. Go to the folder you've just cloned the code and execute:
```
$ npm install
```
3. Create a ```.env``` file in your project's container folder. The file should have the following variables with your own values:
```
API_URL="ALCHEMY_API_URL"
PRIVATE_KEY="METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY"
BASESCAN_API_KEY="BASESCAN_API_KEY"
```
4. Compile the contract
```
$ npx hardhat compile
```
5. Deploy the contract
```
$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network baseSepolia
```
6. Verify the contract
```
$ npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia <DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```
